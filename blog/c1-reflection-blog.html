    <h1>The Story about Shereef's Fireside Chat </h1>
    <pre>
      <h4>
      Nowadays, IT industry is a fast-growing market in Auckland. Thus, there is a variety of IT institutes as well as many e-learning system.
      I think that most these education systems are operated by <em>Restaurant(Customer) mindset</em> which was mentioned by Shereeef
      This is because many students buy a curriculum such as learning javascript,CSS and HTML course, and also individuals learn these from the teacher. 
      Sometimes, they pay on-line courses and learn from lecture who exist on the screen, as if customer order food in the restaurant.
    
      In this case, there is no creative interaction between them. Everything just depend on teacher's ability and only individuals' capability.  

      However, after watching the Shereef's video, I felt a strong impression and difference.
      I believe that DBC/EDA is totally different learning system to others. It is a much more creative system.
      
         <em>"Make together" </em> is totally different mindset as if people make food in the kitchen with their friends together.
                    I was thought from Sheereef's Chat that I did not order Bootcamp package. I am a memeber of Bootcamp, 
                                    and we develope it through workking together.

    <h3>Deep impression of EDA </h3>
    <p> 
      Software development is a team sports such as soccer,basketball and rugby. It is not a individual games like tennis <br> 
      When we build a project team there are people who have great experience in IT, while otheres do not have sufficient IT knowledge. <br>
      This is a very similar with playing team sports becuase every member can not have superior ability.<br> 
      Also, individuals have different IT skills and knowledge in the project, as if soccer team member has different role during playing game.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people said that this is a my program and I will make them by myself. However, this is not a suitalble mindset in EDA.<br>
      In IT project or IT organization, all tasks are developed by coorperation between colleagues, even experienced project manager learn <br>
      from junior developere. <br>
      <em>We can make successful projects and output from working together.</em> we can exchange their advantages from accepting others opinion<br>
      I discovered that humble mindset is very significant because it can cause growing interatction among member and it can creative thinking.<br>

      Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

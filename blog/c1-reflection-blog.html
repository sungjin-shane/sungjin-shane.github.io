    <h1>The Story about Shereef's Fireside Chat </h1>
    <pre>
      <h4>
      Nowadays, IT industry is a fast-growing market in Auckland. Thus, there is a variety of IT institutes as well as many e-learning system.
      I think that most these education systems are operated by <em>Restaurant(Customer) mindset</em> which was mentioned by Shereeef
      This is because many students buy a curriculum such as learning javascript,CSS and HTML course, and also individuals learn these from the teacher, 
      Sometimes, they pay on-line courses and learn from lecture who exist on the screen, as if customer order something that they like food in the restaurant.
    
      In this case, there is no creative interaction between them. Everything just depend on teacher's ability and only individuals' capability.  

      However, after watching the Shereef's video, I felt a strong impression and difference.
      I believe that DBC/EDA is totally different learning system to others. It is a much more creative system.
      
         <em>"Make together" </em> is totally different mindset as if people make food in the kitchen with their friends together.
         I was thought from Sheereef's Chat that I did not order Bootcamp package. I am a memeber of Bootcamp, and we develope it through workking together.

      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

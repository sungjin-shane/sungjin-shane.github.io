      <h1>The Story about Shereef's Fireside Chat </h1>
      <h4>
      Nowadays, IT industry is a fast-growing market in Auckland. Thus, there is a variety of IT institutes as well as many e-learning systems.
      I think that most these education systems are operated by <em>Restaurant(Customer) mindset</em> which was mentioned by Shereeef.
      This is because students buy a curriculum such as learning javascript, CSS and HTML, and also individuals learn these from the teacher. 
      Sometimes, they pay online courses and learn from lecture who exist on the screen, as if customer order food in the restaurant.
    
      In this case, there is no creative interaction between them. Everything just depends on teacher's ability and only individuals' capability.  

      However, after watching the Shereef's video, I felt a strong impression and difference.
      I believe that DBC/EDA is totally different learning system to others. It is a much more creative system.
      
         <em>"Make together" </em> is totally different mindset as if people make food in the kitchen with their friends together.
                    I was thought from Sheereef's Chat that I did not order Bootcamp package. I am a member of Bootcamp, 
                                    and we will develop it by workking together.

    <h3>Deep impression of EDA </h3>
    <p> 
      Software development is a team sport such as soccer, basketball and rugby. It is not an individual game like tennis <br> 
      When we build a project team there are people who have great experience in IT, while others do not have sufficient IT knowledge. <br>
      This is  very similar with playing team sport because all members can not have superior ability.<br> 
      Also, individuals have different IT skills and knowledge in the project, as if soccer team member has a different role during playing game.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people said that this is my program and I can make them alone. However, this is not a suitable mindset in EDA.<br>
      In IT project or IT organization, all tasks are developed by cooperation between colleagues, even experienced project manager learn <br>
      from junior developere. <br>
      <em>We can make successful projects and output from working together.</em> we can exchange their advantages from accepting others opinion<br>
      I discovered that humble mindset is very significant because it can cause growing interaction among member and it can creative thinking.<br>
    </p>   
       
    <h3>How can I engage with this type of culture </h3>
    <p> 
      I have a quite long times IT experience, so when I started phase0 I had a strong confidence.<br>
      However, I realized that I need more skills and knowledge, even here is New Zealand not Korea <br>
      I have to speak English for communication to members all day long, also working environment and style are very different to Korea.<br>
      I forgot a lot of technics because recently I should focus on project management. For example, I should managed people and schedule,<br>
      and I should organized team and meeting instead of focusing on coding. Information technology has changed quickly over the years.<br> 
      Now, I need to learn a variety of communication tools and adapt a new development environment like GITHUB as well as new methodology<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that socializing can have infinite potentials in EDA community. From this, I can gain useful information to overcome <br>
      my disadvantages. Also, I will learn how can communicate with native speakers by English, and I will be able to understand their culture.<br>
      I will jump in the community and connect with them. From humble mindset, I will meet and talk to everyone, and I will share my experience.<br>
    </p>
   
    <h3>Expectation for EDA</h3>
    <P>
      I feel that Education system in EDA is well organized and it has very specific tasks to achieve individuals goals.<br>
      It is still too early to tell the expectation because I did not completely experience EDA culture but if I have to suggest one <br>
      During the phase-0, as long as DEV Academy holds an official meeting for each cohort monthly at the campus It will be a good opportunity <br>
      to closely communicate among members. <br> 
    </P>

    <h3>My feeling about participating this kind of environment</h3>
    <P>
      Honestly, I am a little bit nervous. As I mentioned early, I moved from South Korea, so when I talk to native speakers I am really nervours.<br>
      Also, I do not have enough understanding to work environment and culture in New Zealand.<br>
      <em>Thus, I choosed EDA course because they teach working together based on humble mindset.</em> <br>
      I think I will overcome these handicap from learning together and deep dive in the community. I have already received warm help from members <br>
      using Slack messanger. It was amazing because It is good eptiome to show something that although I may be unable to handle difficult problems alone,<br>
      we are able to solve difficult issues from sharing their skills and knowledge.<br>
      
      Now, though I have anxiety about the future, I believe that I will release this through working together.

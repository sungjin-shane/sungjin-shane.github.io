    <h1>The Story about Shereef's Fireside Chat </h1>
    <h3> 
      <pre>
      Nowadays, IT industry is a fast-growing marcket in Auckland.
      Thus, there is a variety of IT institutes as well as many e-learning system.
      Most these education system are operated by <em>customer mindset</em>
      For example, when we go to the restaurant people just order somethign that they like food,
      and they pay. They buy javascript,css and html course, like that.
      Also individuals learn those thing from teacher, even sometimes learn from lecture who exist in the screen. That's all. 
      There are any creative interaction between them. All things are depend on teacher, and there are no  

      However, after watching the Shereef's video, I felt a strong impression and difference.
      I believe that DBC/EDA is totally different learning system to others. It is very creative system.

      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.

    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

            <p>
              IT projects often fail due to poor team dynamics rather than a lack of technical ability. Software development today is a team effort.

                The emotional intelligence is one of the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life.<br>
                Also, its competencies are something you can deliberately acquire with practice.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions</li>
                <li> <strong>Self-regulation:</strong> Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources</li>
                <li> <strong>Motivation:</strong> Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
                <li> <strong>Empathy:</strong> Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns</li>
                <li> <strong>Social skills:</strong> Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others</li>
            </ul>          
            <p>
                There is a good epitome of emotional intelligence as a learned ability. It is <strong>the story of Ebenezer Scrooge</strong> in A Christmas Carol.
                Scrooge's intrapersonal intelligence was so low. However, Scrooge presents an example of elevated emotional intelligence.
                He develops strong self-awareness, he becomes capable of controlling his own emotional destiny, and his empathy and social skills blossom.

                What can emotional intelligence do for us? In the context of the work environment, emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets
            </p>
            <ul>    
                <li> <strong>Stellar Work Performance</strong></li>
                <li> <strong>Outstanding Leadership</strong></li>
                <li> <strong>The Ability to Create the Conditions for Happiness</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The way to develop high-resolution perception of emotion is <strong>to apply mindfulness</strong> to the body. 
                Every emotion has a correlate in the body and bringing the attention to the body enables a high-resolution perception of emotions.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Mindfulness in Two Minute </strong> For two minutes a day, we quietly enjoy being alive and being together.   
                <br>Mindfulness is embarrassingly easy because we already know what it’s like.“paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.”
                Put most simply.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>
             <em> All you have to do is sit without agenda for two minutes and just switch to Easy</em>
            </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>The hard part in mindfulness practice </strong> is deepening, strengthening, and sustaining it.</li>
                <li> <strong>Easy Way </strong> is to simply bring gentle and consistent attention to your breath for two minutes.</li>
                <li> <strong>Motivation:</strong> Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
                <li> <strong>Any time you decide</strong> you’d rather just sit without agenda, just switch to Easier. No questions asked.</li>

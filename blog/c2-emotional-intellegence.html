            <h2>What learnings did you take from Search Inside yourself?</h2>    
            <p>
                The emotional intelligence is one of the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life.<br>
                Also, its competencies are something you can deliberately acquire with practice.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions</li>
                <li> <strong>Self-regulation:</strong> Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources</li>
                <li> <strong>Motivation:</strong> Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
                <li> <strong>Empathy:</strong> Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns</li>
                <li> <strong>Social skills:</strong> Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others</li>
            </ul>          
            <p>
                There is a good epitome of emotional intelligence as a learned ability. It is <strong>the story of Ebenezer Scrooge</strong> in A Christmas Carol.
                Scrooge's intrapersonal intelligence was so low. However, Scrooge presents an example of elevated emotional intelligence.
                He develops strong self-awareness, he becomes capable of controlling his own emotional destiny, and his empathy and social skills blossom.
            </p>

            <p>what can emotional intelligence do for us? In the context of the work environment, emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets</p>
            <ul>    
                <li> <strong>Stellar Work Performance</strong></li>
                <li> <strong>Outstanding Leadership</strong></li>
                <li> <strong>The Ability to Create the Conditions for Happiness</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The way to develop high-resolution perception of emotion is <srong>to apply mindfulness</strong> to the body. 
                Every emotion has a correlate in the body and bringing the attention to the body enables a high-resolution perception of emotions.

            <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Mindfulness in Two Minute </strong> For two minutes a day, we quietly enjoy being alive and being together.   
                    <br>Mindfulness is embarrassingly easy because we already know what it’s like.“paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.”
                    Put most simply.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>The hard part in mindfulness practice </strong> is deepening, strengthening, and sustaining it.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Easy Way </strong> is to simply bring gentle and consistent attention to your breath for two minutes.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Motivation:</strong> Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
                    <li> <strong>Any time you decide</strong> you’d rather just sit without agenda, just switch to Easier. No questions asked.</li>

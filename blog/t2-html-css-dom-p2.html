            <p>
                Nowadays, grid-based design or layouts have become very popular in web design.   
                A grid is a series of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines that serve as guides to place elements in a design.
                To put it in simple words, grids are a system for creating order among elements in a website. 
                Grid helps users to better understand the information as it is shown in a more structured and logical way.

        <p>
            All html tags have a meaning that can be not only understood by browser, but also make sense to all developers.    
            Semantic structure generate clear codes which are going to organizing more specific pieces of information.
            Also, it should be explained that all about meaningful groups of tags have structured order.

            <ul>
                This shows us a couple of very important behaviors associated with block and inline boxes:
                <li>Block boxes always appear below the previous block element. This is the “natural” or “static” flow of an HTML document when it gets rendered by a web browser.</li>
                <li>The width of block boxes is set automatically <strong>based on the width of its parent container.</strong><br>In this case, our blocks are always the width of the browser window.
                <li>The default height of block boxes is <strong>based on the content it contains.</strong> When you narrow the browser window, the 
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> gets split over two lines, and its height adjusts accordingly.</li>
                <li>Inline boxes don’t affect vertical spacing. They’re not for determining layout—they’re for styling stuff inside of a block.</li>
                <li>The width of inline boxes is based on the content it contains, not the width of the parent element.</li>
            </ul>

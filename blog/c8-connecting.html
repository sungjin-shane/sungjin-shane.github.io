                <p>Working together and sharing benefits equally was our team's slogan. but it can be achieved from strong trust and sincerity.
                   Also, teamwork is very important to reach the target. If every memeber has strong trust to boss, the other way, the boss has strong
                   conviction for members. It can make a huge synergy.

                            In my experience, having a strong trust needed quite long times, but at first, giving a positive mind to someone was very significnat.
                            Most employees do not want to change their circumstance such as colleagues, boss and office environments.
                            Especially, when new boss come in to replace old boss, many team members refuse to give warm mind to new boss. 
                            However, during my 15 years work experience, when I give my positive and warm mind to others, most people return the same mind to me.
                            Of coures,ometime there were people who returned unexpected reaction. But Normally, starting with positive mind each other was vital to make
                            strong trust.

                       " People thirst for others to understand their feelings." <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I already haven been trying empathic listening with my wife. Normally, I did not focus on listening my wife's voice
                       But I realized that was the root problem that we always argue together. Most people hope that someone listens to their voice,
                       but it is really hard to listen to someone's voice. This is because people just want to tell their vocie, and do not want to listen to others.
                       <br><br>

                       However, when I listen to my wife's vocie whithout interrupting, it makes suprised situation. Once she finished her talking
                       she found out her problems by herself. I just listened to her talking with warm eyes. It is fantastic skill, just listen to others
                       and send warm herarts to them. Sometimes listening is better than speaking.

                    <p>
                        I love this that "kindness is a sustainable source of happiness" <br>
                        Although you are facing with hard situation that you cannot handle it, you can change the hard situation into a new phase.
                        Nowadays I have felt that giving kindness to others allows me to share happyness. When I talked to my son with kindness tone, he also 
                        repied warm attitude.  When we are surrounded hard issues, kindness and warm heart make us escape the hard situation.

                    <p>
                       There was conflict opinion to make difficult decision when I worke for company as a IT specialist.
                       At that times, Our Database server of SAP ERP System did not work by hardware's technical fault, thus all DBA and SAP technician
                       came in office to recover the DB server. We had a meeting for 10 hours and we decide to use image backup solution to recover it.
                       I reported this choice to CIO, but he was so angry to me because if the image backup solution will does not wok, all 20 years Database
                       are unable to recover.<br><br>
                       
                       In my view, It was perfect decision because there was any soution to cover it in the world. I called 5 oracle DBA in Oracle Korea, and I
                       also called 3 SAP BC inclue singapore HQ member. We had deep discussion. Unless we urgentely applied the solution huge on going 
                       tranction data will be disappear. <br><br>
                       
                       On the other hand, the CIO had to make good decision because the decision making was his role. Thus he wanted to check all IT specialist to 
                       had done complete review the problem. Also, he needed perfect solution that had not any other risk factors. But it had a risk that the 
                       DB Server will be removed by image backup solution. <br>

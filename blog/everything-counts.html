                    Some gifts from God shine or explode or resound. These are abvious ones. We see these in others and think God skipped
                    us in the gift line. Those simply are not your gifts. Think about what it is you are doing when you feel the most alive.
                    This is when you are closest to God. Today ask God to show you how to use your own gift in the world he has given you to share.

                   Sometimes, people got easily angry such as emperor Nero to others when somethig went wrong way that they did not want.<BR> 
                   People got easily shouted when they was unable to solve problems. They got easily frustrated when they failed in their business. 
                   However, although indivuduals showed the strong and worst reaction against them, there were any change that it would be solved. 
                   Otherwise, only their anger was continuously increased, and othere people tried to shift off them. 
                   What is the proper reaction when we face with these situation? <strong>Pray for real strength, </strong>You will need it. Patience, Kindness, Compassion,
                   <strong style="color:blue">A sense of humor.</strong> You are going to need them all. Better start praying now.

                    Eventually, you will want to get to the point where everything is for Jesus. Easy? Hardly.
                    If you say everything is for him. then you better be prepared to go through what he went through
                    Exaustion, Rejection, Rersecution, Betrayal, Death. Yes death-not of your body, but of your old life.
                    You are going to be asked to leave it behind and get a new one. Are you ready for that? You can do it in his strenght.
                    <br><br>
                    I also agree that it is really hard to leave old things. When I faced with difficult problems every day
                    I am still use my old things to solve the issues but I have to try to leave my way, and apply a new way that he is everything.
                    Not your interseting, and physical greed in lives. Recently, I am getting better than before, and I begin to meet a new world through getting throw it away. 
                    <br><br>
                    Yes. As a matter of fact, it is hard-and it is going to get harder.
                    <strong style="color:blue"> But it is kind of like a hard rain. Changes comes next. </strong>

                    There are a lot of people who ask "Why God why?" over and over. God almost always has the same answer. "Because I said so".
                    There may not be banners with your name streched across the door when you get back. Also, there is no reason that you should go.
                    However, we go because god said "Go". We do it because God said "Do it". That is the reward.<br>
                    <strong style="color:blue"> "We do it because God said"</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    God will not always send you someplace pretty, You will not always get applause. You are a servant of God.
                    Now, pray to be sent anyway. Are you willing to spend and be spent; not seeking to be ministered unto, but to minister?
                    <br><br>
                    You are able to find fast way and choose easy way. You may say that this not my way, and I do not want to choose it. <br>
                    We will not always make a successful story. Sometines we need to feel sense of pain in the bitter fail,
                    and we need to be under other people's feet as a doormat.

                <h2 class="blog-header"> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h2>
                <p>When I worked as a team manager I had a compassionate leadership. This is not a my opinion. It is perception of 
                   many other colleagues in the company. However I think that sometimes, company do not want excessive compassionate
                   leadership because it causes negative disorder in work. I believe that the compassionate leadership is essential for every leader
                   because leader is mother or father of team. Thus leaders should understand their memebers' voice, and feel for them. 
                   But, in my experience, some members needed strong leadership because all member did not follow me by compassionate leadereship.
                   A few member might try to take advantage of my characteristic. In this case, When I showed 2 or 3 times compassionate leadership
                   to them, most of them tried to change their negative mindset to coorperate mind, but few member did not try to change their attitude.
                   So, I had to show strong leadership appropriately.

                        It is difficult to understand others' mind. When we meet new people, we normally have wariness against them.
                        Sometimes, people do not trust them. I think it is the same situation in work environment. For example, team member do not
                        want to trust new boss. On the other hand, the boss do not want to trust abilities of the members. However, in organization like department,
                        the trust between boss and members is the most significnat factor. In this case, the multiplying goodness meditation is very useful solution
                        to resove this complex and negative situation in department. In my case, when I meet a new person or join in new department, having a positive
                        mind for new people or environment cause positive effect to understand each other. Imagine, when we meet together in bootcamp which is the 
                        best mindset? Before attending the bootcamp, we need to prcatice the multiplying goodness meditaion. If we do this a lot, eventually, 
                        we will trust every member because we understand each other and care together.

                    <p>
                       I think it is easier to give my compassion to others than receiving others' suffering. Breathing others bad things like dark cloud 
                       is very difficult. But sometimes, I have been felt when I saw others' bad habits I thought I also had the same bad habit. Thus, I believe
                       that once we can accept bad habit individual will clean their own mind that has the same bad habits.

                    <p>
                        I have been tried to have open mind for others during Phase 0. I maked effort for good relationship with others.
                        I think that I was able to apply all SCARF to my phase 0 but I tried to keep Relatedness. Actually I realized that 
                        when I show my warn kindness to others they also give warm feedback. Also Fairness is very important to develope social reationship.
                        Thus, I have made effort to keep one's promise, and I tried to share useful tips and tools for all. 

                        I am really nervous to attend the bootcamp, because I should overcome my handicap which is not goot at fluent English skill.
                        But I think I will be able to overcome it through thinking positive mind and cooperation with other members. I believe that
                        people can make good result when they respect each other, and to share their value.

                    <p>
                       Recentely, I argued with my wife. I should make effort on Bootcamp, so I just want to focus on studying more codes and skills.
                       But due to this, I was unable to give sufficient support to home. I tried to talk to my wife about this hard situation.
                       For the better future, we may need to strggle against difficult time. She hope that I am going to be superman who easily handles both
                       study and family, but I am not a superman. It was really difficult to persuade her but I wish she will understand my stance later.
                       It is on going issue, but I will do my best to family during the bootcamp. I strongly believe that they will trust me by my effort.

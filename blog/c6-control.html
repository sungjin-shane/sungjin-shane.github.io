                <p>
                    <em>"Triggers are also very often connected to a perceived inadequacy about ourselves that is a source of pain to us, sort of like a raw nerve" </em>
                    For example, if I am feeling very insecure about my performance at work, a mere suggestion from my boss that she is slightly concerned about my project’s progress may cause a trigger reaction in me. 
                    In contrast, if I am fully confident about my work, my reaction to my boss will be entirely different.

                        In my case, when I cannot remember syntax of programming language and specific css properties It becomes the triggers.
                        At that time, I feel the disproportionate emotional responese . For example, do I have to remember everything? How can I memorize the syntax and particular codes?

                        <strong>Insecure about my skills in web development</strong><br>
                        There are talented developer who can memorize every syntax and properties in html and CSS. When I compare with them to me I feel the emotional imbalance.

                    <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> 
                            I strongly believe that if we can stop it we already make the 70% of success in management of triggers.

                    <ul> Dealing with triggers and negative emotions
                        <li>Stop</li>
                        <li>Breath</li>
                        <li>Notice</li>
                        <li>Reflect</li>
                        <li>Respond</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Managing negative emotion like triggres is very difficult. In my case, when I face with this triggers I fight against them.
                        It is wrong way to deal with them. The first and most significant step is to stop. "Let it go" and "Do not react for just 10 minutes"
                        Stop enables all the other step. If we stop for a while we can make a chance to deal with triggers and negative emotions.<br>

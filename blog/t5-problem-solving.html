            <p>
                <strong>
                <em>"I studied javascript 17 years ago in my first web based IT project by myself"</em>
                </strong> Its grammar had not large differences with coventional C-language and it was easier to understand than C , so I was able to learn quickly.
                However, when I left the project, my role was changed to back-end programmer based on SQL quite a long time, thus I forgot many of skills in javascripts.  
                From this sprint-4, I was able to remind the javascript basic grammar, and I could organise its difficulties in particular codes.

                            As I said earlier in sprint-0, the Javascript can generate action and flow for the both html and CSS.
                            It is able to express various codes which can control data. and it is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage users.
                            <br>I think JavaScript is a more advanced language to develop web pages dynamic. In comparison with the Javascript HTML is static language.
                            It means the html code is displayed on the browser, and it is unable to change or interact with another user's action otinput.   
                            <strong>The javascripit has a role in web programming that it breaths life into the both HTML and CSS.   </strong>

                        <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> This is designed by just conceptual codes. Although it is unable to apply real source codes into the actual system,
                            I was able to find making a process that could be controled by logic. </p>

                        <p>
                            I used both FOR loop and SWITCH syntax to control my daily life. There was a few syntax errors because I did not make actual function.
                            However you are able to understand how can it works. The two nested FOR loop generates 24hours and 60min life flow.
                            Also, the SWITCH CASE syntax makes trigger action which I should do on time.
                            If you want to make conditions, we can use IF clause. In my case, I used IF clause to make HH:MM system.

                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> I think the fuction is a magic box which is operated independentely and it can be reusable.</p>
                <p>
                   When we use the fuction, we are able to make clear codes and reduce the same source codes which has the same purpose.
                   The function is designed to operate independentely, thus, developers are able to call the fucntions in sources codes where 
                   the function is needed. <br>
                   If we make a e-Commerce web site there will be web pages which need login-process. In this cases, can you imagine to make
                   the same source codes for login process in each web pages<br>
                   It will be really inefficient and leads to negative side effect. This is beacise that if we have to modify the login process 
                   we must update every web pages that have login process. However, if we make login process by function we can easily call the function
                   in the every web pages which are required the login process.

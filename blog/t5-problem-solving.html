                <strong>
                <em>"I believe that there is no almighty programmer who have no errors in program during making new programmes."</em>
                </strong> All developers are encountered to get blocked on simple or difficult problems for making source codes.
                          However, there are various solutions to solve it.

                            In my case, tracking exact values in variables was very difficult problem becuase normally, we are able to check the values only after the process is finished.
                            However, in the middle of coding, we need to check what it goes appropriate way, but we do not have <strong>X-ray system</strong> that shows the values.
                            Thus, I began to find a effective way to check it, and I was able to find it. It was <strong>"Console.log" function.</strong>
                            Most programming languages have a fuction printing the values in source codes such as printf() in C language. In Javascript, it has more powerful and easy function, that is the "console.log"
                        </p> 
                        </div>
                    </div>   
                    <P>
                        If I use it I can check values and I am able to check that my logic has proper flow. Using the console.log is easy, I just put the function into several place where I want to track both values and flow.
                        After that, once I run the code I can check errors or data from the logs in screen because it shows the values whether it is wrong or not.
                    </P> 
                    <p>
                        I strongly believe that dubugging habit is very siginificant while studying code. Thus, the console.log helps me trace errors in my source code, and I can make debugging process. 
                        Don't be afraid of finding bugs and errors. These are necessarily happened while coding, and you can find that your code makes wrong process or forwards wrong values by console.log like X-ray scanning at airport.

                <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process.</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pseudocode</strong> <br>
                    It helps developers easily understand the code through informal high-level description in source.<br>
                    <strong>Trying something</strong><br>
                    We could not anything in coding without trying something. it is basic method to find errors, and we can find problems by trying to change codes.
                    Also, we are able to find useful solution from the trying something when you face with difficult problems.<br>
                    <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong><br>
                    Sometimes, we fell like fall in deep trap while coding. We just cannot make up writing next source code.
                    If the codes has too much twisted logic and errors, Rubber ducky method will be a good method to solve it.
                    We needs times to check the codes from first to last slowly. We will naturally find several errors which are twisted
                    while explaining your codes to the rubber duck.<br>    
                    <strong>Reading error messages</strong><br>
                    Why we do not know easy way to solve the errors?. The compiler and interpreter already know problems in our codes.
                    Thus, they show the error messages on the screen. However, normally, we do not read it carefully and completely.
                    In most of the cases, the error messages guide to find grammartical errors in codes.<br>   
                    <strong>Console.logging</strong><br>
                    I already mentioned that It is the easies way to trace your codes, and it is more useful when it is used with other method.<br>
                    <strong>Googling</strong><br>    
                    "Google is everything" There are a lot of solution. It is easy to find it, just copy your error messange into the googles. However, if you too much depend on
                    this way you cannot enhance your skills in coding. When you find solutions in google, you should re write codes by yourself. Do not copy the whole code what you find in google into your code.<br> 
                    <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong><br>  
                    Perhaps it is the surest way to resolve problems. The coaches have been experienced a variety of problems in coding. So they already know exact solution with useful advice.<br>
                    <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong><br>
                    We can make best practice from continuous improvement the codes by refelction. Discussing problems with colleagues and coach helps us find more useful ways.
                    First of all, we should have a habits writing annotatio on codes because it helps others understand your codes, and it prevents codes from wrong modification.

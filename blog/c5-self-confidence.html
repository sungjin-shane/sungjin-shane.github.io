                        The book suggested a simple relationship between mindfulness and competencies of self-awareness
                        that strong emotional awareness leads to more accurate self-assessment, which in turn leads to higher self-confidence.
                        <br>
                        <strong>How can deal with the EMOTIONAL AWARENESS?</strong><br>
                        Firstly we should recognise our own emotions throuch clarifying their own mind. SePeople can view myself from third person perspective. From this, because I do not ready for listening. <br>
                        Also, I got distracted by my own feelings and internal chatter. After that, people are albe to know the objective about emptional experience.
                    </p> 
                    </div>
                </div>    
                <p>
                    Secondly, we need accurate self-assessment. It is important to have honest about my own strengths and weakness.
                    Then, we should clearly set goals by priorities, and we are able to be comfortable with miself.
                    This process will be connected with self-confidence.

                    <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> 
                        I am feeling now is...Just write...A few minutes of writing will suffice.
                    </p> 
                    <ul> Journaling : taking 30 minutes write about something I found to be emotionally significant.
                        <li>What I am feeling now is..</li>
                        <li>I am aware that...</li>
                        <li>What motivates me is...</li>
                        <li>Today, I aspire to..</li>
                        <li>What hurts me is...</li>
                        <li>I wish... love is... Others are...</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I am able to find myself. It is very significant thing because I can clarify my wrong habits and mindset.<br>
                        Also, journaling generates fresh air for my daily life in the morning. <strong>I would not rush into work or study </strong>
                        because this is not a helpful way to make  proper goals.
                        I can measure current emotional status and it helps me organise serious emotional issues.
                        I am albe to control my physical limit, thus it helps me not to be burned out.<br>
                        Firs of all, it makes me to understand others from finding my excessive greed that I will do everything by my ways.

                    <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> 
                        We can handle it, and it just small changes of mind, not you!
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        The emotions are simply what you feel, not who you are..<br>
                        My emotions are not me, thus Emotions become what we experience in the body, so we go from “I am angry” to “I experience anger in my body.”
                        I strongly agree with the figure of speech that houghts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, 
                        some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go. 
                        Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind and body that come and go.

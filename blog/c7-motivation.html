                <p>
                   Most people pursue pleasure, and I also spend most of time on seeking just enjoyable things.
                   However, it does not sustainalbe happyness because once the enjoyable stimulus ceases, then our happiness will return our default set point in mind.
                   For example, when we go to hunting, and we take a big deer we can gain super pleasure. But after that, we will easily lose our pleasure, and people should seek another stimulus to maintain their pleasure.
                   <br>I realized from reading the chaper 6 that setting up higher target is the best way to make more sustainable pleasure.
                   <br>This is because our tasks in works are able to be stimulus that can make sustainable hapyness. 
                   Although, it is difficult to realize the importace of setting a higher goal once we are working toward fulfilling our higher purpose, 
                   the progress itself is the reward like bonus. 
                   <br>There is an example in company. When people work in the company they have their own target for a year or month known as <strong>KPI(Key Performace Indicator)</strong>.
                   I know that in a way, it causes stressful situation to employees, otherwise, most employees are able to gain a satisfaction from working toward fulfilling their target.

                    <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> 
                       " Don't afraid of failure that is the building block of success." <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The resilience ideas casuses positive effects. The most siginificant thing is that having a optimistic mind
                       because it gives strong power that overcomes hard situation.<br><br>

                       Today, I had annoying situation because GPS of my phone lost siginal several times, thus I was unable to find faster route.
                       At that time, I was so angry because it took much more times than before. However when I arrived in Campus
                       I can realize that I was able to learn the proper path from home to here due to this annyoing event.

                       As a matter of fact, it is hard to have resilience ideas, but it is kind of like a hard rain. Changes comes next.
                       When we meet the hard situation, just let it go, and have a deep breathe or a cup of coffee
                       I believe that the hard situation is not alwasy bad thing, from this we can have other positive effects.<br><br>
                       Are you sure that you can control everything in your life? Sometimes, you lose something and sometimes, you gain more benefit than before.
                       
                       Don't afraid of challenging something, and feel the pain of failures. At this time, we should apply our resilience mindset
                       because those pains are just hard rain that clean up ground and valuable building block of success".

          <p>
          <strong>
            <em>"Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?<br> How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?" </em> <br>
          </strong>
          <p>
            It was a quite difficult to expain those things whiout technicak words. However, from the Udacity lesson,
            I was able to learn easy way explaining the technical jargon. 
          </p>
          <strong>
            <em>If you can think of a website much like your house you could be easily understand.</em>
          </strong>
            <p>
            <em style="color:blue;">HTML files</em> are like the structures where wall is placed, so we could see kitchen, living room and bed room etc.<br>
            <em style="color:blue;">CSS</em> is the style of your house like interior and outerior design, so we could decorate house such as painting the wall, carpet and doors.<br>
            <em style="color:blue;">DOM (Document Object Model)</em> is a good method to build the house(Website) by two experts both HTML(builder) and CSS(designer).<br>

                    <p>
                        The box model is our toolkit for customizing layout scheme, and it consists of four elements. <br>
                        A major part of our work as a web developer will be to apply rules from the CSS box model to turn a design mockup into a web page. 
                        why we have to learn all these rules instead of just uploading a giant static image of a web page (i.e., a mockup) to a web server and calling it a day.<br>
                        1.Content : The text, image, or other media content in the element. <br>
                        2.Padding : Padding property defines the padding for the selected element. <br>
                        3.Boarder : A line drawn around the content and padding of an element <br>
                        4.Margin  : It defines the space outside of an element’s border. Or, rather, the space between a box and its surrounding boxes. <br>                      
                    </p>

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
            <p style="font-size:20px; color:blue;"> Although it sounds strange, we can find a answer if we imagine most display screen in devices such as laptop's monitor, tablets and mobile phones. </p>
            <p>This is because boxifying design is the most suitable solution to print all web elements on the screen in rectangular shape.
               All web elements like image, text and linked objects will be easily placed on web pages. After that, it can be modified from applying various attributes on the elements such as position, size and colour etc.
               Also, this design methodology allows people to establish standard framework and hierarchy.

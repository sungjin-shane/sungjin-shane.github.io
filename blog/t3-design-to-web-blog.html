            <p>
                <strong>
                <em>"I redesigned my web site"</em> by useful tools and frameworks such as responsive web structure,Skeleton CSS, and wireframe design. <br>
                </strong>
                It was a diffrent approach when I compare with web site that I made before. I could reduce development times by templates that I redesigned from using wireframe.
                It shows more sense of unity, and the responsive web gives suitable interface on other devices.

                            The responsive site can be resizing on screens which are various styles such as laptop, monitors, and mobile phones.<br>
                            Nowadays, people use a variety of devices that have diffrent screen size. Thus, unless web sites support responsive web, 
                            its contents will not be able to give apropreate information and effects in design to users. <br>

                <h2 class="blog-subtitle">What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h2>
                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> Here is simple answer. Once mobile design meets the requirement, designing for other screens in various devices will be easier. </p>
                <p>
                    The opposite approach can easily lead to trial and error because in all cases, people should be experienced cutting down tasks
                    The problem with opposite approach is that when people build the all-inclusive design right from the start, 
                    the core and supplementary elements merge and become harder to distinguish and separate.<br>
                    If your web site is perfect on a mobile devices, it is suitable to otehr devices.

                <h2 class="blog-subtitle">What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h2>
                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> Frameworks are well organized aggregation of soruce codes which are easily reusable.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>[Advantages]</strong> Frameworks help developer make web pages by predefined source codes. Thus, It can reduce development period, and it decrease software errors.
                    This is because all source codes in frameworks are proven through testing and debugging. Also, It supports various function which is difficult to be used by novice coders.
                    <br>
                    <strong>[Disadvantages]</strong> Beginner developers can be easily depended on convenient function in frameworks because it offers various class that are hard to make.
                    Due to this, some developers do not understand the algorithm and rules of source codes, and they will not develop by themselves.

            <div clasbes="blog-section">
                <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h2>
                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> Wireframes are used to design web pasges based on simple design elements</p>
                <p>
                   Before developing actual source codes and custom CSS, the wireframe shows outline and configuration in the web sites like blue print document.
                   It uses black lines and simple patterns like rectangles, text box, and symbols.<br>
                   I experienced several difficulties, and the lack of sense in balance was the most difficult. Once I designed proto type on paper by my pen, 
                   It was unable to apply on actual web pages because it was too detailed and small. Thus I use design tool named balsamiq mockups.

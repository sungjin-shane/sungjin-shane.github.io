                    <em>"Just acknowledge that something is happening."</em> It is a solution, and if you tend to react and judge you should waste your energy.
                    Do not judge it to be good or bad.

                        Once I thought of meditation, I could imagine psychotheraphy from learning yoga and sepecial ways of breath and relaxation. 
                        I would like to have emotional relaxation by praying for God and I have strongly believed that it makes people's mind clean up.
                        Also, I felt that it helps reduce stress in workplace because having a relax time prevent people from increasing of stressful emotion.

                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> The happiness is the default state of mind. </p>
                <p>
                    If the mind becomes calm and clear, it returns to its default. it does not become more special status.
                    The default status is happiness. That is it. Some people may expect to happen wonderful magi.
                    Returning the mind which is natural is the purpose of meditation.

                <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> Thank you always for everythings</p>
                <p>
                    I believe that unstable mindset is from greed which cannot reach it. 
                    Before meditation, if people thank God for giving today that can try everything they will not try to rush hardly.
                    People can satisfy a little things like breathing with air, and their mind will be free.

                <p>
                   Normally, people tend to judge something that they do not like. However, if it is possible, try not to react it.
                   If people really have to react, try to take five breaths before reacting. It means let it goes or be because letting go
                   is not forcing something to go away. Instead, letting go is an invitation.
                   In my experience, when I read books in the library, young boys made much noise around me. I immediately had 5 breathing times
                   After that, I was able to maintain quiet times. <br>
                    <strong style="color:red">
                        However, at that time, If I reacted about it, would I change the situation what I want to do?.

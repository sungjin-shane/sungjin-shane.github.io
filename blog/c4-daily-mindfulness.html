                        There are three key points in mindfulness converstion. <br>
                        1)listening 2) looping 3)dipping <br>
                        In my case, I often have been argued with my wife. This is because I do not ready for listening. <br>
                        Also, I got distracted by my own feelings and internal chatter. <br>
                        I tried to apply mindfullness conversation on conversationing with my wife. It showed amazing results.<br>

                <p>
                    It has very simple three components.
                    Firstly, just listening to others' opinion and do not reaction to what other person said.
                    Secondly, we are easily able to check what others said from looping process. It reduce the gap of understanding between you and other person.
                    Lastly, checking in with ourselves is difficult because we have a lot of feelings and internal chatter during the conversation
                    but we can maintain it from acknowledging them. "Know that they are there, try not to judge them, and let them go if they are willing to go."

                <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> If you have religion have you been prayed everyday? </p>
                <p>
                    Having a sustainability in mindfulness practice is difficult. In my case, before starting daily work, I have a quite time for pray,
                    and from this, I could gain energy to live. Also I always realize that I am nearest to the god once I have the fewest wants.
                    But until I have this daily habit, It took 3 years. Can you imagine, I always failed to pray everyday, but tried again and again.
                    I would like suggest to have a meditaion time before opening a your laptop. You can easily remind meditaion time once you open laptop in the morning.
                    I did not open my laptop without having a my quite time.

                <p style="font-size:15px; color:blue;"> Talking about your feelings with someone</p>
                <p>
                   If you have family or friends talking to them about your meditation experiences.
                   It is better than keeping it to yourself<br>

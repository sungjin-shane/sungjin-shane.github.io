      <h1>The Story about time-and-habits</h1>
      <em>"Wheter working with time on good habits or struggling against those" </em> <br>
        In my case, I do not have enough times trying to learn phase-0 because I have to handle my regular working tasks during the day.
        Also, I should help my wife and take care of my children during the night.
        Thus, it is really difficult to maintain both work and study without learning excellent time management skills and great habits.
        
        However, There are a lot of techniques and ideas on how to develop these skills and habits. 
        Although I was unable to introduce everything, I would like to explain several ideas that fit me.

    <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3>
      <h4>-Pomodoro timebox</h4>
      Mainly, I tried to use pomodoro methodology because it is really simple and easy to apply different styles' work <br>
      [1] Choosing my tasks                                               [2] Setting the timer to suitable minutes] <br>
      [3] Working avoid checking the remainaing on timer and distraction] [4] Taking a few minutes break] <br>    
      
      <h4>-Create tiny behaviors</h4>
      There was an amazing video that impressed me [Link]<br>
      Dr BJ Fogg's said in the video <em>"When we know how to create tiny habits, we can change your life forever."</em> <br>
        <img src="tiny_behavior_change.jpeg" alt="Smiley face" height="300" width="300"> 
      As we can see the above image, 3 elements at same moments affect to people's behaviors which lead to outcome <br>
      Behavior = Motivation * Attitude * Trigger (This is significant) <br>
      What was interseting, most people could experience failure due to focusing on high motivation and it is hard to continuously maintain.<br>
      Dr, BJ Fogg recommend people to use low motivation effect because it is easier to succeed and it makes much more excellent behaviors.<br>
      <em>Making the behaviors tiny with effective triggers </em> is the key point. <br>
        <img src="tiny_habit_example2.jpeg" alt="Smiley face" height="300" width="300"> 
      This is the example of tiny behaviors that change your life forever. So I decided to make tiny behaviors.<br>
    </p>

      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      After reading and watching various ideas for time management, I found that many people said that the Pomodoro is a template. <br>
      It means I can modify it work for me. When I applied the Pomodoro timebox to my study or work <br>
      I felt that sometimes, the 25 minutes interval was too short or sometimes, it is too long. It was getting be distractions <br>
      Thus, I thought I need modification about timebox duration. It is not an interesting thing others but I was so interesting.<br>
      Firstly, I classified my work as working category such as reading websites, watching a videos and coding programmes, etc.<br>
      Secondly, I simulated suitable timing scheme from my last history of study and work. (It just like a heuristic method.)<br>
      Lastly, I was able to define each interval for my classified work type. My thought trying to apply the same timing scheme was wrong.<br>
    </p>   
       
    <h3>what worked for you? </h3>
    <p> 
      Most of them, for focusing on my study, I changed several things that negatively influence on my study <br>
      One of the most important change was to prevent my working times from distraction. (Noise, Mobile phone, other gadgets) <br>
      -During the studying times, I did not watch SNS and messenger. When I choose the study time I try to avoid family time<br> 
      -A place where I do my tasks was very important, so I made study room for learning phase-0 during the weekday, <br>
      -I decided to go to the library during the weekend because the library is the best place to focus on my tasks without distraction. <br>
      
      Also, as I mentioned that for changing my habits, I began to apply several tiny behaviours with proper triggers like below template, <br>
      <em>After I [existing habit-Trigger] -->I will [new tiny behavior]</em> <br>
      1ST) After I open my laptop, I will have 10 minutes meditation times and do not rush to coding.<br>
      2RD) After I start my study or work, I will turn on my toggle button<br>
      3RD) After I finish my study on a laptop, I will stop my toggle button. This is just example of improving time management. <br>
           
     
    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <P>
      I would like to develop my tiny behaviours like Dr BJ Fogg's behaviours. He has over 20,000 tiny habits. It is amazing.<br>
      He said that breaking our life into tiny behaviours, and put them in the right spot which is after something we are already doing<br>
      Then, let them allow grow. We don't have to amp up motivation, and we don't need to draw that much on willpower.<br>
      So, I will continuously apply these tiny behaviours to a variety of individuals' goals such as maintaining a good health,<br>
      balancing between work and home.<br>  
              
      Also, I was realised that not only do people effectively focus on microtasks by applying the time management tools,<br>
      but having a big picture of roadmap navigating a right way to goals also very significant.<br>
      Thus, I will try to measure an amount of the whole sprint, and I will break the tasks down that I handle,<br>
      and lastly, I would like to drow mind-map to avoid losing my pace. <br>

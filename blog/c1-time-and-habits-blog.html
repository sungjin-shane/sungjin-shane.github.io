      <h1>The Story about time-and-habits</h1>
      <p><em>"Wheter working with time on good habits or struggling against those" </em> <br>
        In my case, I do not have enough times trying to learn phase-0 because I have to handle my regular working tasks during day.
        Also, I should help my wife and take care of my children during night.
        Thus, it is really difficult to maintain both work and study without learing excellent time management skills and great habits.
        
        However, There are a lot of techniques and ideas on how to develop these skills and habits. 
        Althoug I was unable to introduce everything, I would like to explain several ideas that fit me.
      </p>

    <p>
    <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3>
      <h4>-Pomodoro timebox</h4>
      Mainly, I tried to use pomodoro methodology because it is really simple and easy to apply different styles' work <br>
      [1] Choosing my tasks                                               [2] Setting the timer to 25 minutes] <br>
      [3] Working avoid checking the remainaing on timer and distraction] [4] Taking 5 minutes break] <br>    
      
      One of the most important things is to prevent my working times from distraction. (Noise, Mobile phone, other gadgets) <br>
      A place where I do my tasks was very important, so I made study room for learning phase-0 during weekday, <br>
      and I decided to go to library during weekend because the library is the best place to focus on my tasks without distraction. <br> 

      <h4>-Create tiny behaviors</h4>
      There was a amazing video that impressed me [Link]<br>
      Dr. BJ Fogg's said in the video <em>"When we know how to create tiny habits, we can change your life foever."</em> <br>
        <img src="tiny_behavior_change.jpeg" alt="Smiley face" height="300" width="300"> 
      As we can see the above image, 3 elements at same moments affect to people's behaviors which lead to outcome <br>
      Behavior = Motivation * Attitude * Trigger (This is significant) <br>
      What was interseting, most people could experience failure due to focusing on high motivation and it is hard to continuously maintain.<br>
      Dr, BJ Fogg recommend people to use low motivation effect because it is easier to succeed and it makes much more excellent behaviors.<br>
      <em>Making the behaviors tiny with effective triggers </em> is the key point. <br>
        <img src="tiny_habit_example2.jpeg" alt="Smiley face" height="300" width="300"> 
      This is the example of tiny behaviors that change your life forever. So I decided to make tiny behaviors.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      After reading and watching various ideas for time management, many people said that the pomodoro is a template. <br>
      It means that we can modify it work for individuals. When I applied the pomodoro timebox to my study or work <br>
      I felt that sometimes, the 25 miniutes interval was too short or sometimes, it is too long. It was getting be a distractions<br>
      Thus, I thought I need modification about timebox duration... <br>
      Firlstly, I classified my work as working category such as reading websites, watchaing a videos and coding programmes, etc.<br>
      Secondly, I simulated suitable timming scheme from my last history of study and work. (It just like a heuristic method.)<br>
      Lastly I was able to define each interval for my classified work type. My thought trying to apply the same timming scheme was wrong.<br>
    </p>   
       
    <h3>what worked for you? </h3>
    <p> 
      I have a quite long times IT experience, so when I started phase0 I had a strong confidence.<br>
      However, I realized that I need more skills and knowledge, even here is New Zealand not Korea <br>
      I have to speak English for communication to members all day long, also working environment and style are very different to Korea.<br>
      I forgot a lot of technics because recently I should focus on project management. For example, I should managed people and schedule,<br>
      and I should organized team and meeting instead of focusing on coding. Information technology has changed quickly over the years.<br> 
      Now, I need to learn a variety of communication tools and adapt a new development environment like GITHUB as well as new methodology<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that socializing can have infinite potentials in EDA community. From this, I can gain useful information to overcome <br>
      my disadvantages. Also, I will learn how can communicate with native speakers by English, and I will be able to understand their culture.<br>
      I will jump in the community and connect with them. From humble mindset, I will meet and talk to everyone, and I will share my experience.<br>
    </p>
   
    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <P>
        Lastly, I will try to make work timebox that is based on 
        and I changed my timming scheme to 50 minutes/10 minutes break.<br> <br> 
        Also I realise that not only do people effectively focus on micro tasks from aapplying the time management using pomodoro process,<br>
      but having a big picture to track right ways to goalsmeasuring amount of tasks also very significant. This is because without setting goals, measuring amount of tasks and planning long, we are able to easily lost direction 

      Also, breaking the tasks down   
      I was able to realize that measuring the amount role during playing game.<br>
    </P>

    <h3>My feeling about participating this kind of environment</h3>
    <P>
      Honestly, I am a little bit nervous. As I mentioned early, I moved from South Korea, so when I talk to native speakers I am really nervours.<br>
      Also, I do not have enough understanding to work environment and culture in New Zealand.<br>
      <em>Thus, I choosed EDA course because they teach working together based on humble mindset.</em> <br>
      I think I will overcome these handicap from learning together and deep dive in the community. I have already received warm help from members <br>
      using Slack messanger. It was amazing because It is good eptiome to show something that although I may be unable to handle difficult problems alone,<br>
      we are able to solve difficult issues from sharing their skills and knowledge.<br>
      
      Now, though I have anxiety about the future, I believe that I will release this through working together. <br>




      Thus I began to alppy 3 tiny behaviors with proper triggers like this, After I [existing habit-Trigger] -->I will [new tiny behavior]<br>
      1ST) After I open my laptop, I will thank God for the new day.
      2ST) After 
      

      Break our life to tiny behaviors and
      put them in the right spot
      the right spot is after something yor are already doing
      and allow to grow 
      you don't have to amp up motivation
                        draw that much on willpower

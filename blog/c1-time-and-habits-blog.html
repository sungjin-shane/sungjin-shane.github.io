    <h1>The Story about time-and-habits </h1>
    <pre>
      <h4>
      <em>"Wheter working with time on good habits or struggling against those" </em>
           In my case, I do not have enough times trying to learn phase-0 because I have to handle my regular working tasks during day.
           Also I should help my wife during night.
           Thus, it is really difficult to maintain both work and study without learing excellent time management skills and great habits.
           
           However, There are a lot of techniques and ideas on how to develop these skills and habits. 
           Althoug I was unable to introduce everything, I would like to explain several ideas that fit me. 
       </h4>
    </pre>   

    <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3>
    <p> 
      <h4>Pomodoro timebox</h4> <br>
      Mainly, I tried to use pomodoro methodology because it is really simple and easy to apply different styles' work <br>
      [1] Choosing my tasks                                               [2] Setting the timer to 25 minutes] <br>
      [3] Working avoid checking the remainaing on timer and distraction] [4] Taking 5 minutes break] <br>    
      
      One of the most important things is to prevent my working times from distraction. (Noise, Mobile phone, other gadgets) <br>
      A place where I do my tasks was very important, so I made study room for learning phase-0 during weekday, <br>
      and I decided to go to library during weekend because the library is the best place to focus on my tasks without distraction. <br> 

      <h4>Create tiny behaviors</h4> <br>
      There was a amazing video that impressed me [Link]<br>
      Dr. BJ Fogg's said in the video <em>"When we know how to create tiny habits, we can change your life foever."</em> <br>

    </p>
    <p>
      However after reading and watching various ideas for time management, Not only do I use the time management tools like pomodoro, <br>
      but measuring amount of tasks and breaking the tasks down also very significant. <br>
        
      I was able to realize that measuring the amount role during playing game.<br>
    </p>   
       
    <h3>How can I engage with this type of culture </h3>
    <p> 
      I have a quite long times IT experience, so when I started phase0 I had a strong confidence.<br>
      However, I realized that I need more skills and knowledge, even here is New Zealand not Korea <br>
      I have to speak English for communication to members all day long, also working environment and style are very different to Korea.<br>
      I forgot a lot of technics because recently I should focus on project management. For example, I should managed people and schedule,<br>
      and I should organized team and meeting instead of focusing on coding. Information technology has changed quickly over the years.<br> 
      Now, I need to learn a variety of communication tools and adapt a new development environment like GITHUB as well as new methodology<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that socializing can have infinite potentials in EDA community. From this, I can gain useful information to overcome <br>
      my disadvantages. Also, I will learn how can communicate with native speakers by English, and I will be able to understand their culture.<br>
      I will jump in the community and connect with them. From humble mindset, I will meet and talk to everyone, and I will share my experience.<br>
    </p>
   
    <h3>Expectation for EDA</h3>
    <P>
      I feel that Education system in EDA is well organized and it has very specific tasks to achieve individuals goals.<br>
      It is still too early to tell the expectation because I did not completely experience EDA culture but if I have to suggest one <br>
      During the phase-0, as long as DEV Academy holds an official meeting for each cohort monthly at the campus It will be a good opportunity <br>
      to closely communicate among members. <br> 
    </P>

    <h3>My feeling about participating this kind of environment</h3>
    <P>
      Honestly, I am a little bit nervous. As I mentioned early, I moved from South Korea, so when I talk to native speakers I am really nervours.<br>
      Also, I do not have enough understanding to work environment and culture in New Zealand.<br>
      <em>Thus, I choosed EDA course because they teach working together based on humble mindset.</em> <br>
      I think I will overcome these handicap from learning together and deep dive in the community. I have already received warm help from members <br>
      using Slack messanger. It was amazing because It is good eptiome to show something that although I may be unable to handle difficult problems alone,<br>
      we are able to solve difficult issues from sharing their skills and knowledge.<br>
      
      Now, though I have anxiety about the future, I believe that I will release this through working together.

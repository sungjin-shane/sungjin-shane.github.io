So I must be learned 6Sigma to make sure quality of design in WBS structure. I recommended making DMAIC WBS template include best practice. It could be loaded into each PI project. So, it allowed PI initiative leaders to reduce workload for managing their projects. Also, the PMS offered visibility for all progress of initiatives, and it supported to spread process innovation in all department within overseas factories. </p>
